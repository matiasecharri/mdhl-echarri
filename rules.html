            <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>            
           The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
            to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <h4> IHF FIELD REGULATIONS </h4>

            <ul class="listanumerosaver">
                <li>
           DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
</li>
<li>
COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program must be 
a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
field may be required to play all their games away.
</li>

<li>
FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS 
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="listaletrasaver">
    <li>
U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields
